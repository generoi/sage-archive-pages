# Sage Archive Pages

## Installation

Install the composer package.

    composer require generoi/sage-archive-pages

This relies on the [Custom Query Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-archive-mapping/) plugin to map
archives to pages. Eventually we should just drop the plugin and incorporate the logic here.
